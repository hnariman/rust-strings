#Title

Just experimenting with String methods in Rust

there are 2 types of Strings

&str - which is helt in stack memory and we know it's malloc size in
compiletime as well as in runtime

String - which is held it heap memory and naturally is extendable and better
for mutable string we are willing and planning to manipulate

exploring best practices for memory management in Rust, since IMHO this is the
future of Cloud Computing and overall network/system programming for the nest
5 years or so
