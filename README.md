### Objective:

Just experimenting with String methods in Rust

### Foundings:
There are 2 types of Strings

__&str__ - which is helt in stack memory and we know it's malloc size in
compiletime as well as in runtime

__String__ - which is held it heap memory and naturally is extendable and better
for mutable string we are willing and planning to manipulate

*exploring best practices for memory management in Rust, since IMHO this is the*
*future of Cloud Computing and overall network/system programming for the nest*
*5 years or so*
